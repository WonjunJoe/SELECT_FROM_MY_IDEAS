**Product Name:** Select From My Ideas

**Version:** 1.0

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-12

### Vision
Transform raw, unstructured ideas into concrete, actionable outcomes through intelligent multi-turn conversations that progressively clarify and refine user thoughts.

### Problem Statement
People often have vague ideas, scattered thoughts, or abstract concepts but struggle to:
- Organize thoughts into actionable steps
- See concrete options from abstract ideas
- Make decisions when possibilities feel overwhelming
- Know when they've thought through something enough

### Solution
A two-agent AI system that:
1. **Main Agent**: Analyzes input, generates questions/options, and decides when to conclude
2. **Synthesizer**: Creates final actionable output when ready
